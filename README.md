# F1-Chinese-GP-2025-Winner-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Predict the winner of the 2025 Chinese F1 Grand Prix using historical race data and machine learning! This project leverages the fastf1 library to fetch 2024 Chinese GP race data, combines it with hypothetical 2025 qualifying times, and applies a Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict race lap times. The driver with the fastest predicted lap time is declared the winner. Built with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, this project is ideal for F1 enthusiasts and data scientists looking to explore sports analytics. Contributions are welcome to enhance features, improve prediction accuracy, or extend to other races!
