# F1-Chinese-GP-2025-Winner-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Predict the winner of the 2025 Chinese F1 Grand Prix using historical race data and machine learning! This project leverages the fastf1 library to fetch 2024 Chinese GP race data, combines it with hypothetical 2025 qualifying times, and applies a Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict race lap times. The driver with the fastest predicted lap time is declared the winner. Built with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, this project is ideal for F1 enthusiasts and data scientists looking to explore sports analytics. Contributions are welcome to enhance features, improve prediction accuracy, or extend to other races!

Breakdown of the Description
Opening Hook: "Predict the winner of the 2025 Chinese F1 Grand Prix using historical race data and machine learning!" grabs attention by stating the projectâ€™s purpose in an engaging way.
Methodology Overview: Explains the use of fastf1 for data fetching, the combination of 2024 race data with 2025 qualifying times, and the use of a Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict lap times.
Prediction Logic: Clarifies that the winner is determined by the fastest predicted lap time, giving a clear idea of the approach.
Tools Used: Mentions Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, which helps users understand the tech stack.
Target Audience: Appeals to "F1 enthusiasts and data scientists," broadening its appeal.
Call to Action: Invites contributions to improve the project or extend it to other races, encouraging collaboration.
# F1 Chinese GP 2025 Winner Prediction Using Machine Learning

Predict the winner of the 2025 Chinese F1 Grand Prix using historical race data and machine learning! This project leverages the `fastf1` library to fetch 2024 Chinese GP race data, combines it with hypothetical 2025 qualifying times, and applies a Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict race lap times. The driver with the fastest predicted lap time is declared the winner. Built with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, this project is ideal for F1 enthusiasts and data scientists looking to explore sports analytics. Contributions are welcome to enhance features, improve prediction accuracy, or extend to other races!
